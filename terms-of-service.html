            <ul>
                <li>Capturing photos, videos, and audio recordings at the scene of an incident</li>

        <!-- 3. The Attorney Referral Service -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. The Attorney Referral Service</h2>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p>ℹ️ This section explains how the optional attorney matching feature works, who operates
                it, and how attorneys are compensated. Please read carefully.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Who Operates the Referral Service</h3>
            <p>
                The attorney referral service is operated by Win It With Lilit, P.C. ("WIWL"), a
                professional corporation and licensed law firm owned by Lilit Gevorgyan, Esq., a
                licensed attorney. WIWL is a separate legal entity from Appalanche Inc.
            </p>

            <h3>How Attorney Matching Works</h3>
            <p>
                If you choose to use the attorney referral feature, the App will share your incident
                documentation with WIWL, which will match you with a licensed personal injury attorney
                based on your case type, location, and other relevant factors. You are under no
                obligation to use this service or to hire any attorney recommended to you.
            </p>

            <h3>Referral Fees</h3>
            <p>
                When WIWL refers you to an attorney and your case results in a settlement or verdict,
                WIWL may receive a referral fee from the attorney handling your case. This referral fee
                is typically 25–33% of the attorney's fee, depending on applicable state bar rules.
            </p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p>💰 IMPORTANT: The referral fee comes out of the attorney's portion, NOT in addition to it.
                Your total legal fees do not increase because of this referral arrangement.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Your Consent Is Required</h3>
            <p>
                Before any attorney referral is made, you will be asked to provide informed, written
                consent to the fee-sharing arrangement in compliance with ABA Model Rule 1.5(e) and
                applicable state bar rules. You may decline at any time.
            </p>

            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You are never obligated to use the attorney referral service</li>
                <li>You may choose your own attorney at any time</li>
                <li>You may decline any attorney match without penalty</li>
                <li>You may withdraw your consent to the fee-sharing arrangement at any time before a fee agreement is signed</li>
                <li>The total fee charged to you does not increase due to the referral</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- 4. No Attorney-Client Relationship -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. No Attorney-Client Relationship</h2>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <p>⚠️ IMPORTANT: Using IncidentApp does NOT create an attorney-client relationship with
                Appalanche Inc., WIWL, or any attorney.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                The App is a documentation tool. The information, reports, analyses, and suggestions
                generated by the App are for informational and documentation purposes only and should
                not be construed as legal advice or legal counsel.
            </p>
            <p>
                An attorney-client relationship is only created when you sign a formal engagement
                agreement directly with a licensed attorney. Being matched with an attorney through the
                App does not by itself create an attorney-client relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should consult with a qualified attorney for legal advice specific to your situation.
            </p>

            <h3>Ownership</h3>
            <p>
                You retain full ownership of all content you create or upload using the App, including
                photos, videos, audio recordings, scanned documents, and incident reports. Your data
                belongs to you.
            </p>

            <h3>How We Use Your Data</h3>
            <p>
                By using the App, you grant Appalanche Inc. a limited, non-exclusive license to process
                your content solely as necessary to provide the App's services. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Processing photos and documents through OCR to extract text</li>
                <li>Generating incident reports from your collected data</li>
                <li>Timestamping evidence for integrity verification</li>
                <li>If you opt in, sharing your incident documentation with WIWL and matched attorneys for the purpose of attorney referral</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Sharing with Attorneys</h3>
            <p>
                If you choose to use the attorney referral service, your incident documentation
                (including photos, reports, and contact information) will be shared with WIWL and the
                matched attorney. This sharing only occurs after you provide explicit consent. You may
                review what data will be shared before consenting.
            </p>

            <h3>Local Storage</h3>
            <p>
                Your incident data is stored locally on your device. If you delete the App, locally
                stored data will be removed from your device. Any data previously shared with attorneys
                or uploaded to cloud services will not be affected by deleting the App.
            </p>

        <!-- 8. AI & Automated Processing -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>8. AI & Automated Processing</h2>
            <p>The App uses artificial intelligence and automated systems to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extract text from scanned documents (OCR)</li>
                <li>Parse and organize document data (driver's licenses, insurance cards, vehicle registrations)</li>
                <li>Analyze photos and videos for quality and completeness</li>
                <li>Generate incident reports and narrative summaries</li>
                <li>Suggest relevant questions based on your incident type</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How We Protect Your Data During AI Processing</h3>
            <p>
                Your privacy is built into our AI pipeline. Before any personal or sensitive information
                is sent to AI services for processing, it is masked and tokenized — meaning personally
                identifiable details (such as names, addresses, and policy numbers) are replaced with
                anonymized placeholders. The AI processes the structure and content of your documents
                without seeing your actual personal information.
            </p>

            <h3>Third-Party AI Services</h3>
            <p>
                The App uses Google Cloud services for optical character recognition (OCR) and related
                processing. We maintain a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with Google to ensure that
                any data processed through their services is handled in compliance with applicable
                privacy and security requirements, including HIPAA standards.
            </p>

            <h3>Accuracy</h3>
            <p>
                AI-generated content may contain errors or inaccuracies. You are responsible for
                reviewing and verifying all extracted data and generated reports before relying on them.
                The App provides tools to edit and correct any AI-processed information.

            <h2>9. Evidence Integrity</h2>
            <p>
                The App offers optional evidence integrity features, including timestamping and
                blockchain verification. When you use these features:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A cryptographic hash (digital fingerprint) of your evidence is created to verify it has not been altered</li>
                <li>If blockchain verification is enabled, the hash is recorded on a public blockchain as a permanent, tamper-proof record</li>
                <li>The actual content of your files is NOT stored on the blockchain — only the hash</li>
                <li>Blockchain records are permanent and cannot be deleted or modified</li>
                <li>Small transaction fees may apply for blockchain verification (currently covered by us)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Evidence integrity features are designed to help establish the authenticity and timing
                of your documentation. They do not guarantee any specific legal outcome.

            <h3>Medical & Health Information</h3>
            <p>
                The App may collect information about injuries and medical symptoms as part of incident
                documentation. This information is stored locally on your device and is only shared if
                you explicitly choose to share it (for example, with a matched attorney).
            </p>
            <p>
                While we take measures to protect sensitive health information, please be aware that
                IncidentApp is not a healthcare provider and is not subject to HIPAA in the same way
                as your doctor or hospital. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy for full
                details on how medical information is handled.
            </p>

            <h3>Location Data</h3>
            <p>
                The App may request access to your device's location services to automatically capture
                the location of an incident. Location data is only collected when you actively use the
                incident documentation features and grant permission. You can disable location access
                at any time through your device settings.
