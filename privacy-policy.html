                Appalanche Inc. ("Company," "we," "our," or "us") operates the IncidentApp mobile

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Help you document accident scenes comprehensively</li>
                <li>Generate incident reports from your collected data</li>

        <!-- Data Processing & AI -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Data Processing & AI</h2>
            <p>IncidentApp uses artificial intelligence and automated systems to help you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Extract text from scanned documents such as driver's licenses, insurance cards, and vehicle registrations (OCR)</li>
                <li>Parse and organize document data into structured formats</li>
                <li>Analyze photos and videos for documentation quality and completeness</li>
                <li>Generate incident reports and narrative summaries</li>
                <li>Suggest relevant questions based on your incident type</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How We Protect Your Data During AI Processing</h3>
            <p>
                Your privacy is built into our AI pipeline. Before personal or sensitive information
                is sent to AI services for processing, it is masked and tokenized — meaning personally
                identifiable details (such as names, addresses, and policy numbers) are replaced with
                anonymized placeholders. The AI processes the structure and content of your documents
                without seeing your actual personal information.
            </p>

            <h3>Third-Party AI Services</h3>
            <p>
                The App uses Google Cloud services for optical character recognition (OCR) and
                Anthropic's Claude for document parsing. We maintain appropriate data processing
                agreements with these providers to ensure your data is handled in compliance with
                applicable privacy and security requirements.
            </p>

            <h3>Accuracy</h3>
            <p>
                AI-generated content may contain errors or inaccuracies. You are responsible for
                reviewing and verifying all extracted data and generated reports before relying on
                them. The App provides tools to edit and correct any AI-processed information.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Data Storage & Security -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Data Storage & Security</h2>
            <p>Your incident data is primarily stored locally on your device. When you choose to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Back up to the cloud</strong> — your data is stored on encrypted servers provided by Supabase (hosted on AWS infrastructure)</li>
                <li><strong>Use blockchain timestamping</strong> — a cryptographic hash (digital fingerprint) of your evidence is recorded on a public blockchain. No personal data is stored on-chain.</li>
                <li><strong>Request a consultation</strong> — your case information is securely transmitted to our attorney referral partner</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect
                your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or
                destruction. These include encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest, access controls,
                and regular security reviews.

        <!-- Sharing of Information -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
            <p>
                We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information only in
                these circumstances:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>With your explicit consent</strong> when you request a legal consultation through the optional attorney referral service operated by Win It With Lilit, P.C. (see our Terms of Service for details)</li>
                <li><strong>With service providers</strong> who assist in App functionality, including cloud storage (Supabase), AI processing (Google Cloud, Anthropic), and analytics</li>
                <li><strong>To comply with legal obligations</strong> or respond to lawful requests from authorities</li>
                <li><strong>To protect rights and safety</strong> — to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, or that of our users or others</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the California
                Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to know what personal information
                we collect, the right to delete your data, and the right to opt out of the sale of
                your personal information. We do not sell personal information.

        <!-- Location Data -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Location Data</h2>
            <p>IncidentApp requests location access to document where incidents occur. Location data is used to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Record the exact GPS coordinates of an accident</li>
                <li>Find nearby security cameras that may have footage</li>
                <li>Obtain weather conditions at your location</li>
                <li>Generate accurate incident reports</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Location data is only collected when you actively use incident documentation features
                and grant permission. You can disable location access at any time through your device
                settings, though this will limit some App functionality.

            <p>
                Local data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App. Cloud-backed
                data is retained for as long as you maintain an account. If you request deletion of your
